# Home Material Intelligence Platform — Domain Brief

Status: **Phase 1 — foundation**. This is the anchor doc for this domain;
read it before re-deriving architecture context in a future session (see
CLAUDE.md §6). It intentionally stays lightweight — not the full docs/
hierarchy sketched in the original discovery brief — until there's enough
real code to justify splitting it.

This product is a **separate domain** from the rest of Product Match (the
Indian ethnic-fashion retailer SaaS). It must not inherit fashion/garment
taxonomy, prompts, schemas, or business rules. It may share generic
infrastructure — see "What's shared" below.

---

## Product thesis

> Make better material decisions before you spend money on your home.
> See it. Understand it. Compare it. Buy it.

Understand → Explore → Visualize → Compare → Validate → Decide → Source.

Visualization is one capability, not the product. The long-term moat is
accumulated structured material/product/decision data, not any one AI
model — architecture should treat AI providers as replaceable.

## V1 scope (locked)

- **Surface**: walls only.
- **Materials**: paint, wallpaper, wall texture, wall panels.
- **Geography**: India-first; currency/units/terminology/retailer-discovery
  are config, not hardcoded into core domain logic.
- **Two customer modes**: "I know what I want" (product-accurate path) vs.
  "help me choose" (requirement-driven recommendation path).
- **Two visualization fidelities**: quick AI preview (exploratory, freer
  generative interpretation) vs. product-accurate preview (preserves real
  product colour/pattern/scale/repeat + everything else in the room).
- **Commerce model**: consumer-first experience + retailer catalogue/lead
  backend. Not a marketplace — no checkout/payment/logistics in V1.
- Not in V1: floors, tiles, kitchens, bathrooms, countertops, furniture,
  contractor/installer tooling, self-serve retailer onboarding.

## Locked decisions (2026-09-07)

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Consumer identity | New dedicated table (`HmUser`), not `Customer` | Keeps domains separable per the "shared infra, not shared domain logic" rule; `Customer` carries fashion-commerce fields (tryOnCredits, ShopOrder/Wishlist relations) that don't belong here |
| Retailer side | New `HmRetailer` model, **admin-seeded only for V1** | No self-serve onboarding yet; mirrors how `ShopCollection` is admin-curated today; keeps the existing fashion `User` (retailer) model untouched |
| Top-level route | `/materials` | Scope-neutral — won't need renaming as Phase 2/3 add flooring, tiles, kitchens, etc. (unlike `/walls`, which is scoped to V1 and would force an SEO-costly rename later) |
| Auth mechanism | Reuse the OTP-over-cookie *pattern* (`lib/customer-auth.ts`), new cookie names, no DB table for pending OTP | Proven, stateless, cheap; the pattern is generic infra even though the identity table isn't |
| Schema location | New models appended to the existing `prisma/schema.prisma`, `hm_` table prefix | Matches how this repo already holds many unrelated domains in one schema file; avoids the overhead of a second datasource for no real benefit at this scale |

## What's shared vs. domain-specific

**Shared (generic infra, reuse as-is):**
`lib/db.ts` (single Prisma client), `lib/serialize.ts`'s `serializeArray`/
`parseArray` primitives (not `deserializeProduct`/`deserializeRecommendation`
— those are hardcoded to the fashion `Product` shape), Cloudinary client,
pg-boss/worker queue infra, `components/ui` primitives, the `AiUsageEvent`
cost ledger (new `feature` values, e.g. `"hm_visualization"`,
`"hm_room_analysis"` — the column is already free-text), admin `TaskItem`
backlog.

**Not shared (fashion-domain IP, never touched or imported by this domain):**
`lib/matching-engine/*` (protected — CLAUDE.md §4), `lib/garment-intelligence/*`,
`lib/fashion-designer/*`, `lib/model-gen/*`, `lib/catalogue-motion/*`, the
`Product`/`Recommendation`/`ShopOrder`/`RentalOrder`/`Customer`/
`ClientProfile`/`User` models and their business logic.

**Architecturally inspired by, but independently implemented:**
- Deterministic scorer + explainer split (`lib/matching-engine/scorer.ts` +
  `explainer.ts`) → this domain's own recommendation engine. No code reuse
  — the weights/rules are entirely different (material suitability, not
  garment cross-sell) and the fashion scorer is protected IP.
- "Structured JSON, not prose" + "absence is information, never invent it"
  (Garment Intelligence's hard-won lessons, see root `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md`)
  → this domain's room/surface CV analysis output shape.
- Deterministic post-generation mask compositing (`lib/model-gen/erase.ts`)
  → the technique for guaranteeing "preserve the room" (Constitution
  Principle 2) in product-accurate visualization: don't trust the model to
  respect a mask boundary, composite the edit against the original
  afterward.
- `GuestTryOnUsage`'s device-scoped free-quota pattern → this domain's
  visualization usage limits (V1 needs a cost policy before shipping, same
  reason the AI-usage ledger/wallet system exists for the fashion product).

## AI boundaries (locked, per Constitution §15)

| Layer | Responsibility | Not responsible for |
|---|---|---|
| Computer Vision | Wall/surface/furniture/window/door detection, geometry, lighting, structured facts only | Commercial recommendations |
| Material Knowledge | Category-level properties (durability, maintenance, moisture, install/removal), curated/config data | Being generated live per-request |
| Product DB | SKU facts, identity, attributes, source/evidence | Being defined by the image model |
| Recommendation Engine | Deterministic/hybrid scoring over room + requirements + material + product data | Arbitrary LLM-invented scores |
| Visualization Engine | Applying material to a surface; pattern scale/repeat/orientation; preserving everything else | Silently substituting a similar-looking material for the real SKU |
| LLM | NL understanding, explanations, comparisons, summaries over already-computed structured results | Being an uncontrolled source of product specs |

## Data model (V1 draft — see `prisma/schema.prisma`, `hm_`-prefixed models)

`HmUser` → `HmProject` → `HmRoom` → `HmSurface` → (`HmMaterial` and/or
`HmProduct`) → `HmVisualization` → `HmRecommendation` → `HmShortlist` →
`HmRetailer`/`HmRetailerProduct` → `HmLead`. Provenance is first-class via
`HmProductEvidence` (one row per fact per product, with `sourceType` —
manufacturer/retailer/user/platform/ai_inferred/external_verified/
unspecified) — not retrofitted later. `HmSurface` carries an explicit
`measurementSource` (`ai_estimated` | `user_confirmed` | `professional`) so
a convincing estimate is never silently treated as a measurement (§11,
Constitution Principle 6).

Comparison and Shortlist are collapsed into one `HmShortlist` table for V1
(simplification proposed during discovery, not yet contradicted by real
usage data — revisit if/when the two need to diverge).

## Open / deferred (not yet frozen)

- **Room-photo privacy policy** — flagged as a gap during discovery, not in
  the original brief. Needs an explicit principle (default-private, no
  retailer/marketing use without consent) before real room photos are
  collected from real users.
- **Minimum viable catalogue depth** for launch — not yet defined; both
  recommendation quality and product-accurate visualization are bottlenecked
  on real `HmProduct`/`HmRetailer` data existing.
- **Material Knowledge content** (durability/maintenance/moisture text per
  subtype) is likely the true critical path for the "help me choose" mode —
  content work, not code. Not yet started.
- Full `docs/` hierarchy (product/domain/ai/architecture/research/decisions)
  from the original discovery brief — deliberately not built yet; this
  single doc is the placeholder until there's enough content to justify it.

## Known environment issue (pre-existing, not caused by this work — resolved)

Local dev Postgres had migration-history drift from `prisma/schema.prisma`:
one genuinely stuck failed migration plus 12 migrations whose schema effects
were already present in the DB but never recorded (likely applied via
`db push` at some point), all reconciled via `prisma migrate resolve`
without touching any data (2026-09-07). Separately, 4 orphan entries from an
abandoned local branch (`rnd/image-pipeline-benchmarks`) remain harmlessly
in `product_match_dev`'s `_prisma_migrations` table — dead bookkeeping, no
live table, left alone.

## Local database isolation (locked, 2026-09-07)

**This branch (`feature/home-material-intelligence`) uses its own local
database, `product_match_dev_hm`, not the shared `product_match_dev`.**

Why: while generating the `hm_*` migration, `prisma migrate dev` detected
that the shared dev database already had columns from a *different*,
unmerged, actively-developed branch (`feature/ai-catalogue-motion`, motion
job/QA fields for the ad-reel deliverable) that don't exist in `main`'s
`schema.prisma`. Multiple branches apparently share one local dev database,
so whichever branch you're on can find the DB "ahead" of its own schema —
this is the second time in one session a shared-DB-across-branches drift
came up (see above). Since this domain's new tables have zero existing data
to lose, giving it an isolated DB was strictly cheaper than reconciling
with someone else's in-flight work.

**Practical effect:** `.env`'s `DATABASE_URL` currently points at
`product_match_dev_hm` (not tracked by git — this is a local machine
setting). **Switch it back to `product_match_dev` when working on any other
branch**, or you'll be looking at an empty/different database. The new DB
was seeded by replaying the full existing migration history from scratch —
it has no product/retailer/user data of its own yet.
